The THANKS file:

All distributions should contain a `THANKS' file containing a two column list
of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically sorted. The left column gives
the contributor's name, while the right column gives the last known good email
address for this contributor. This list should be introduced with a wording
similar to this one:

 TBCDB THANKS file

 TBCDB is based on UDB, so our main thanks goes to all UDB developers.

 Furthermore we'd like to say thanks to vladimir, seizerkiller, subhuman,
 X-Savior and all others which helped us getting started with this project.

 For TBCDB 0.0.2 we have specially to say thanks to jovy, as most of the work
 for this release has been done by him.

The easiest policy with this file is to thank everyone who contributes to the
project, without judging the value of the contribution.

Unlike `AUTHORS', the `THANKS' file is not maintained for legal reasons. It is
maintained to thank all the contributors that helped you out in your project.
The `AUTHORS' file can not be used for this purpose because certain
contributions, like bug reports or ideas and suggestions do not require legal
paper exchanges.

You can also decide to send some kind of special greeting when you initially
add a name to your `THANKS' file. The mere presense of a name in `THANKS' is
then a flag to you that the initial greeting has been sent.
